        <div class="textbox">
        Chrom is Lucina's father from...Fire Emblem. He is the echo fighter of Roy, except without the firey spin. So he's basically Marth but a bit different...but most of his moves come from roy? Fire Emblem has a lot of representation huh?

        Mr. Game &#38; Watch is from the "Game and Watch" series that existed back in the 1980s. They were very simple in code, and was the beginning of portable gaming.

        <div class="textbox">
        Metaknight is the dark rival of Kirby. He weilds the galaxia sword, dawns the dimensional cape which allows him to teleport, and he took down Galacta Knight, the strongest warrior in the galaxy. Long story short, Meta Knight is one tough cookie.

        <div class="textbox">
        Dark pit was created with the mirror of truth, a mirror that is able to duplicate people and objects to be the exact opposite. While Pit is upbeat and faithful to Palutena, Dark Pit is much more moody and independant.

        <div class="textbox">
        Samus typically only fights in her phazon suit. But in this case, the gloves come off! She has a neat laser gun that doubles as an electric whip, and she's got some fancy rocket boots! I wonder how high she can fly with those things on...

        <div class="textbox">
        To say Snake lived a simple life would be absolutely ridiculous. He has been constantly dragged into involvement with war, militaries, terrorist organizations, you name it. While his past may be troubled, he is a master weapons expert in combat. Rockets, bombs, hand-to-hand combat, he knows it all!
