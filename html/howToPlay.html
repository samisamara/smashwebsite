        <p>
          Super Samsh Bros Ultimate has plenty of ways to attack, defend, and
          move about the stage! It can be a bit much to process all at once
          since Super Smash Bros is very different from your usual fighting
          game, however, these tips and tricks should help you ge the basics
          down!

            <th class="th">Jump</th>
            <td class="td">
              Jumping is a key part of Super Smash Bros. To jump, simply press
              the x or y buttons, and to double jump, do the same but in mid
              air. You can also jump by tilting the anolog stick upward if you
              have the option turned on. All characters have different jumping
              heights, and some characters can jump more than twice, such as
              Kirby, Meta Knight, and more.

          <tr class="tr">
            <th class="th">Running and Walking</th>
            <td class="td">
              Running is just as important to smash as jumping is. To walk, move
              the anolog stick left or right. To run, move the anolog stick left
              or right very quickly. Sonic is the fastest runner in the entire
              game.

          <tr class="tr">
            <th class="th">Sheild</th>
            <td class="td">
              Sheilding is very important and is a deciding factor on if you win
              or lose. To sheild, press ZL or ZR. This will allow you to block
              attacks and projectiles. Don't use it too much or hold it too long
              or else your sheild will break. Certain moves can completely break
              them if fully charged. If your sheild is broken, you'll be stunned
              for a while and be left open for attacks.
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr class="tr">
            <th class="th">Grab and Throws</th>
            <td class="td">
              Grabbing is equally as important as sheilding. To grab an
              opponent, press L or R when the opponent is close. If the grab is
              successful, you can press L or R repeatedly to pummel the
              opponent. Don't do this for too long or else they'll escape! After
              a grab or a pummel, you can tilt the anolog stick in one of 4
              directions to throw them!
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr class="tr">
            <th class="th">Neutral A</th>
            <td class="td">
              These attacks are basic jabs, punches and kicks. They differ in
              range, type, and power for each character, however that can be
              said for all attacks. To perform a neutral A attack, simply press
              A. Most characters can perform extra hits by press A over and over
              to perform a jab or three hit combo.
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr class="tr">
            <th class="th">Tilts</th>
            <td class="td">
              Tilts are a great way of stringing combos at low percentages. They
              all are performed by pressing A while holding a direction.
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr class="tr">
            <th class="th">Dash Attack</th>
            <td class="td">
              Dash attacks are the attacks mainly used to apply pressure on the
              opponent. In many cases, you can use dash attacks to begin a
              combo. To perform one, simply press A while you're already
              running.
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr class="tr">
            <th class="th">Smash Attacks</th>
            <td class="td">
              Smash attacks are your main method of getting KOs. Press A and a
              direction at the same time to perform a smash attack. If you press
              A and a direction but hold for a bit, you'll perform a stronger
              smash attack!
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr class="tr">
            <th class="th">Arials</th>
            <td class="td">
              Arial attacks are best for situations that involve being in mid
              air such as a falling opponent or recovering to the stage. If you
              press A while holding up, down, forward or backward, you can
              perform different arial attacks. There is also an arial command
              for pressing A without a direction. You can also use the right
              analog stick to perfrom arials if you don't want to move around
              while using an arial attack.
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr class="tr">
            <th class="th">B moves (Specials)</th>
            <td class="td">
              B moves are your game changers and ultimately what makes each
              character so unique. Mario can throw fire balls, Sonic can use the
              spindash, Kirby can inhale opponents and copy THEIR B moves, and
              so on. Just like arial attacks, you can pressing B while holding a
              direction, or press B without pressing a direction.
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr class="tr">
            <th class="th">Up Special (Up B)</th>
            <td class="td">
              Although this is part of the special moves section, Up special is
              especially important. This is essencially your "third jump". It is
              also an attack for most characters. It is mostly refered to as a
              recovery, because it's meant to help you recover to the stage
              after getting knocked off.
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr class="tr">
            <th class="th">Dodge</th>
            <td class="td">
              Dodging can be performed by pressing a direction and the sheild
              button at the same time. This allows you to completely avoid
              attacks. If you use it too much in a short period of time, it will
              become slower and you'll get hit more easily. You can also dodge
              in mid air!
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr class="tr">
            <th class="th">Ledge Grab</th>
            <td class="td">
              If you are off the stage and get close enough to the ledge, you
              will grab it automatically. After you've grabbed the ledge, you
              can either roll back to the stage, perform a ledge attack, do a
              ledge jump, or simply just get back up.
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr class="tr">
            <th class="th">Taunts</th>
            <td class="td">
              For the most part, taunts don't actually do any damage. They are
              mostly there to perform a mini-celebration after getting a KO, and
              to give each fighter a bit of personality! Most taunts are a
              refrence to something from the character's original series! To
              taunt, press up, down, or sideways on the D-pad.
